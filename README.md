# Toxic Comment Classification
## Goal
Our goal is to improve online conversation by exploring various multi-headed Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP methods to build an accurate model thatâ€™s capable of detecting diverse types of negative online comments perceived as toxic. A toxic comment is defined as one that is rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.
